# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Understanding customers isn’t just about knowing *who* they are, but *how* they behave.  
In this project, I used **K-Means clustering** to group customers based on their purchasing patterns, helping businesses understand different customer types and tailor their strategies accordingly.

## What’s this project about?

Imagine running an online store where:
- Some customers spend a lot  
- Some buy frequently  
- Some engage but don’t always convert  

Treating all of them the same doesn’t make sense.

This project explores how **unsupervised machine learning** can automatically segment customers into meaningful groups based on behaviour. These segments can then be used to make smarter business decisions.

Using **K-Means clustering**, customers are grouped based on similarities in their data, allowing an online business to:

- Send more relevant offers to different customer groups  
- Recommend products customers are more likely to be interested in  
- Improve the overall shopping experience through personalisation  

## Dataset

The dataset contains **e-commerce customer behaviour data**, including information related to customer activity and engagement on an online platform.  
It serves as the foundation for identifying patterns and similarities between customers.

## Approach

The project follows a structured analytical workflow:

- Data loading and initial exploration  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns  
- Applying **K-Means clustering** to identify customer segments  
- Interpreting and profiling each customer group  

The focus throughout was not just on applying the algorithm, but on **understanding what each cluster represents from a business perspective**.

## Key Insights

- Customers can be grouped into distinct segments based on behaviour  
- Certain segments show higher spending and engagement  
- Other groups are more price-sensitive or less active  

These insights show how segmentation can support **targeted marketing and retention strategies**.

## Why this matters (Business Impact)

Customer segmentation helps businesses move away from a “one-size-fits-all” approach.  
The insights from this project can support:

- More personalised marketing campaigns
